In order to have channel that's comfortable, cozy, and generally contains interesting and valuable discussion, we have to employ moderation, but our guidelines can almost entirely be summarized as “avoid gratuitous negativity”. The following examples are provided for additional clarity, but are not exhaustive – use your own judgment as to whether you're contributing to the desired environment. 

- **Be civil**. Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face-to-face conversation.
- **Tread lightly with potentially hot-button topics such as classic “religious” arguments.**
    - This includes topics like FOSS, vim vs emacs, problems with a particular programming language, discussion about moderation, etc.
- **Don't troll.** Making comments with the goal of eliciting an emotional response or reaction makes for bad conversation and bad company.
    - A reaction is distinct from a response in that the user needn't post anything to have an emotional reaction.

## Additionally
These don't fall under gratuitous negativity, but they're certainly necessary for our atmosphere.

- **Be generous with NSFW labels.**
    - Here, NSFW is defined as “anything we'd rather you not show someone else's children”. Just err on the side of caution and it should be fine.
- **Don't spam or flood.** This is difficult to define, but the gist is that you should be thoughtful about whether you're disrupting the flow of conversation and/or reducing the signal to noise ratio of the channel.
