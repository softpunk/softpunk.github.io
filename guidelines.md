Rules tell us what **not** to do rather than what **to** do.
They're imposed by those with power on those without.
They create a divide between those who are subjected to them and those who enforce them.
To avoid the issues with traditional rules, we can decide what **to** do as individuals in a community.

- **Be civil**. Remember that you're talking to an actual person.
- **Be mindful when discussing hot-button topics**, such as discussing things you dislike about a particular language, editor wars, discussion about moderation, etc.
- **Be aware of how you're affecting the atmosphere**. Things like trolling, baiting, or splitting messages into multiple lines reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and can permanently lower the channel quality over time.
- **Be liberal with NSFW labels**. If it's not socially accepted to show it to other people's kids, label it NSFW **in the same message**.
