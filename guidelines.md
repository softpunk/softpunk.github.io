Rules tell us what **not** to do rather than what **to** do, and they're imposed by those with power on those without.
So, to avoid the issues with traditional rules, we decide what **to** do as individuals in a community.

- **Be civil**. Remember that you're talking to an actual person.
- **Be mindful when discussing hot-button topics**, such as discussing things you dislike about a particular language, editor wars, discussion about moderation, etc.
- **Don't troll**. Trying to make people angry or upset detracts from the environment for others.
- **Be liberal with NSFW labels.** If it's not socially accepted to show it to other people's kids, label it NSFW **in the same message**.
- **Don't spam or flood.** If you're disrupting the flow of conversation or just generally reducing the signal to noise ratio, reconsider your approach.
