# I can't talk on \#code

**Mibit users**: *Your mibbit account isn't a Rizon account, so you still have to register with rizon.*

**NOTE**: *Make sure there are no spaces or other text before the `/` when entering commands, or your password and email address may be sent to the current channel.*

## I already have an account
If you're not using your registered nick, you'll need to group your current nick by typing `/msg NickServ GROUP <your main nickname> <your password>`, or change to your registered nick. `#code` may prevent you from changing your nick until you've left the channel)

If you're using your registered nick, you just need to login, or "identify", by typing `/msg NickServ IDENTIFY <your password>`.


## I don't have an account
You can make one by typing `/msg NickServ REGISTER <your desired password> <your email>`. Once you've done that, check your email for a confirmation code, then type `/msg NickServ CONFIRM <confirmation code>`.

If you have any problems or more questions, check out [this page here](https://wiki.rizon.net/index.php?title=Nick_Registration) on the Rizon wiki.
