<h3><a href="https://github.com/softpunk/temperate-tabs">Temperate Tabs</a></h3>
<p>A Firefox addon for those of us who have a bad habit of opening dozens or hundreds of tabs at a time. It works by setting a maximum number of tabs (default is 20), warning you once you go past that, and finally preventing more tabs from opening once you're 10 past the limit.</p>
