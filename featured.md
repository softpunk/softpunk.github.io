Each Friday we'll update this page with a different talk, paper, and article. You can see all the talks, papers, and articles we've featured on the site [here](/archive/).

## Article of the week
> If what you have to say is so important the other person must hear it, then you must say it in the way they will most likely hear it — respectfully, clearly, and with empathy and attention to the hearer, to make a space for conversation and clarification.

[How to be Polite (For Geeks)](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-for-geeks-86cb784983b1) is a great explanation both of why politeness matters and how to actually *be* polite in the first place.

## Talk of the week
[The Future Doesn't Have to be Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o) by Alan Kay. The title should be all you need.

## Paper of the week
If you think math is terrible, too hard, or just generally a really boring and time consuming area of study, you **have** to read [Lockhart's Lament](http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). It's short, easy to read, and focuses on the failure of conventional mathematics education. I'm also going to cheat a little bit and recommend this short [high school valedictorian speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts) about the nature of compulsory education.
