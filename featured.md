Each Friday we'll update this page with a different talk, paper, and article. You can see all the talks, papers, and articles we've featured on the site [here](/archive/).

## On hold temporarily for personal reasons (2016-04-30)

## Article of the week
[Immutability is Not Enough](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/immutability-is-not-enough). Immutable data structures are insufficient to eliminate state-related bugs.

## Talk of the week
[Media for Thinking the Unthinkable](https://vimeo.com/67076984). Some thoughts are hard for humans to think. How can we design media to make it easier to think those thoughts?

## Paper of the week
[Studying the Language and Structure in Non-Programmersâ€™ Solutions to Programming Problems](http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~ratana/PaneRatanamahatanaMyers00.pdf). Programming languages are not necessarily designed with the experience of using and learning them in mind. Many programmers still scoff at Ruby's "optimizing for programmer happiness" mentality. But programming languages are a human-machine interface. Can we do better?
