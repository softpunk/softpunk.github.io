Each Friday we'll update this page with a different talk, paper, and article. You can see all the talks, papers, and articles we've featured on the site [here](/archive/).

## No update this week (April 08, 2016)
I'm still getting settled, so for this week, I'm keeping last week's feastures.

## Article of the week
[This one](http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html) is about undefined behavior in C. To me, it really has two main perspectives. If you have to use C, its content is valuable, and if you don't have to learn C, you'll get to see why we need tools that will eventually enable us to stop using it for userland software.

## Talk of the week
[Let's be mainstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYk8CKH7OhE) is about Elm and its emphasis on learning. This is one of my favorite themes, and I think this talk will make it easy to see why.

## Paper of the week
I was busy this week, so I'm going to fall back on an older paper, [the original introduction to Lisp](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.pdf) by McCarthy. It's 34 pages, and should be well-worth your time.
