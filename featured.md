Each Friday we'll update this page with a different talk, paper, and article. You can see all the talks, papers, and articles we've featured on the site [here](/archive/).

## Article of the week
I have a lot of trouble reading as much as I'd like, and I'm sure I'm not the only one in #code with this problem. [Reading for the Rushed](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/02/22/reading/) is about how to improve on this.

## Talk of the week
This week's talk is by a front-end programmer who envied the back-end team, since they weren't stuck using JavaScript. It's [Make the Back-End Team Jealous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FV0DXNB94NE), and discusses the speaker's experiences using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and how he feels like the back-end team has something to envy now.

## Paper of the week
[Reflections on Trusting Trust](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf) details the classic compiler hack by Ken Thompson, in which he gives himself access to every unix system.
